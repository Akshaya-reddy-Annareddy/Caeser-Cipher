# Caeser-Cipher
This Caesar Cipher program allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using a shift key. It shifts each letter in the input by the given key value while keeping uppercase and lowercase letters unchanged. Users can choose encryption, decryption, or exit from the menu. The program runs in a loop until the user decides to exit.
